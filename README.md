# train-times
A Firebase-powered page for displaying train times, arrivals, as well as user inputs.


I utilized Firebase as well as moment.js for this exercise.

Bootstrap was the best for designing he user interface for this exercise because I wanted to mimic the most streamlined kind of app that would be easy on the eyes for most users, as well as to give it a feel of a real-life and fully functional app.

This exercise helped me to learn SOLID ways to take user input and turn it into a usable value that can be used in several functions across the JS file. I'm getting more comfortable here playing with various user input and displaying it how I see necessary.

For example, my favorite moment in creating this project was when I could not convert the "Next Train" times from military time to the longest time. At the time, I was stumped for hours and could not see how to display the time in a user-friendly 12-hour time format, despite re-reviewing the moment.js library on numerous occassions. It then just snapped in one moment how I could do it, and upon testing it worked.
